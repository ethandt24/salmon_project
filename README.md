How do we decide duration of lifecycle? Should t be in years?

Limitations of model: Assumes salmons all follow a synchronous cycle ie. breed and die at the same time. This does not reflect reality. Some types of pacific salmon live 1 year, others 7 years.

Also assumes salmon only die as a result of breeding.
